            <p>Anyone who’s ever gone to buy a birthday or anniversary card in person knows stores shelve and organize cards by their intended audience — labels such as ‘Boy,’ ‘Girl,’ ‘Husband,’ and ‘Wife’ direct shoppers to the section meant for whomever they’re shopping for.</p>
            <p>Haven’t bought a card in a while? No sweat, we pulled thousands of greeting cards off Hallmark’s website and grouped them just like at a store, so you can see what each category looks like:</p>

            <p>For each card assembled, we determined the color that covers the majority (or plurality) of its canvas — the dominant color, in other words. This reveals which colors Hallmark uses most commonly...and which are rarely used (only 10 percent of greeting cards come in green!). Because Hallmark categorizes their cards by recipient, we’re also able to see how they switch up their color schemes across groups.</p>

        <p>38 percent of cards designed for female recipients are either a <span style="color: red;">red</span> or <span style="color: darkviolet;">violet</span> hue (which would include shades of pink), making them the most likely colors a woman will see when she is given a greeting card. The next most offered colors for women are <span style="color: darkorange;">orange</span> (22%), <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> (17%), and yellow (16%).</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, 30 percent of cards designed for male recipients are <span style="color:blue">blue</span>, making it the most likely color a man will see on his cards. The next most offered colors for men are <span style="color:darkorange">orange</span> (22%), yellow (21%), and <span style="color:red">red</span> (13%).</p>
        <p>Curiously, the pink-blue divide is much more pronounced among cards aimed at younger audiences. 42 percent of cards in the ‘Girl’ category are red or violet, while 42 percent of cards in the ‘Boy’ category are blue. To be fair, 23 percent of cards designed for girls are blue, making it their second most offered color. On the flip side, only 12 percent of cards meant for boys are red or violet.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px">Ultimately, the generic usage of pink for cards for female recipients and blue for cards for male recipients reflects similar gender stereotypes evident in other products and industries. Pay attention the next time you go buy a birthday or anniversary card — the aisles may start to feel like walls of baby blue and pink, especially if you’re shopping for a younger age. However, Hallmark does provide some options, so you’ll likely find at least a few red, orange, blue greeting cards in any section...just not green.</p>
        <p><strong>Notes & Methodology</strong></p>
        <p>Images were scraped from <a href="https://www.hallmark.com/" target="_blank">Hallmark</a>, which categorizes greeting cards into groups by recipient. We pulled a total of 4,196 cards from the following categories: Girl, Boy, Daughter, Son, Granddaughter, Grandson, Sister, Brother, Wife, Husband, Mother, Father, Grandmother, Grandfather, Any Woman, and Any Man.</p>
        <p  style="margin-bottom: 150px">Hue was calculated using the RGB values of the dominant color of each card. In cases where white was the dominant color of a card image, we used the second most dominant color instead. Hue shade names (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet) were categorized using ranges from <a href = "https://www.color-blindness.com/color-name-hue/" target = "_blank">Colblinder</a>.</p>
