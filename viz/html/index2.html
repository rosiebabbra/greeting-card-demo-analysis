        <p>Mostly anyone who’s ever bought a birthday or anniversary card knows cards get shelved in groups according to their intended audience - labels such as 'Boy,' 'Girl,' 'Husband,' and 'Wife' will direct consumers to greeting cards meant for whomever they’re shopping for.</p>
        <p>In case you’ve never purchased a greeting card before or just need a reminder, we pulled thousands of cards off Hallmark’s website and grouped them by intended audience. Below you can see the cards designed for various family members, shelved together just like you’d see at a store. </p>

        <p>Each of these cards have a dominant color that covers a majority (or plurality) of their canvas. We found the dominant color for each card and stacked them below, by intended recipient. This gives us an idea which colors Hallmark uses most commonly and how they might switch up the color schema depending on who the card is meant for.</p>

        <p>The clothing and toys industries, among others, are known to color code their products by gender - labeling anything blue as meant for men and anything pink as meant for women. That’s definitely noticeable here too, although there’s some nuance.</p>
        <p>38 percent of cards for female recipients are either a red or violet hue (which would include shades of pink); this makes red and violet the most likely color a woman will see when she is given a greeting card. In order, the next most offered colors for women are orange (22%), blue (17%), and yellow (16%).</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, 30 percent of cards for male recipients are blue, making that the most likely color a man will see on his cards. In order, the next most offered colors for men are orange (22%), yellow (21%), and red (13%).</p>
        <p>The pink-blue divide is much more pronounced among cards aimed at younger audiences. 42 percent of cards in the 'Girl' category are red or violet, while 42 percent of cards in the 'Boy' category are blue. To be fair, 23 percent of cards designed for girls are blue, making it the second biggest color option. On the flip side, only 12 percent of cards for boys are red or violet.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the generic usage of pink for cards for female recipients and blue for cards for male recipients reflects similar gender stereotypes found in other products and industries. Pay attention the next time you go buy a birthday or anniversary card - the aisles may start to feel like walls of baby blue and pink. But hey, Hallmark does provide some options, so you’ll likely find at least a few red, orange, and dark blue greeting cards...just not green.</p>
        <p>Seriously - only 10% of Hallmark’s cards are green! We’re honestly scratching our heads as to why this might be. Sure, green isn’t everyone’s favorite color, but it’s evidently more popular than red, orange and yellow. Perhaps it’s because green is the color of nature and conservation, and greetings cards, well, aren’t doing nature and conservation many favors?</p>

    <p><strong>Notes & Methodology</strong></p>

    <article>
        <p>Images were scraped from <a href="https://www.hallmark.com/" target="_blank">Hallmark</a>, which categorizes greeting cards into groups by recipient. We pulled a total of 4,196 cards from the following categories: Girl, Boy, Daughter, Son, Granddaughter, Grandson, Sister, Brother, Wife, Husband, Mother, Father, Grandmother, Grandfather, Any Woman, and Any Man.</p>
        <p>Hue was calculated using the RGB values of the dominant color of each card. In cases where white was the dominant color of a card image, we used the second most dominant color instead. Hue shade names (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet) were categorized using ranges from <a href = "https://www.color-blindness.com/color-name-hue/" target = "_blank">Colblinder</a>.</p>
